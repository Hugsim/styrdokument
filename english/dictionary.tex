    \maketitle
        \refer{Datateknologsektionen} har alltid haft problem med inkonsekventa översättningar
        av svenska termer. Det här är vårt sätt att (försöka) göra något åt det genom
        att skriva några översättningar.

        The division has always had problems with inconsistent translations
        of terms used in Swedish. This is our way to (try to) alleviate that issue
